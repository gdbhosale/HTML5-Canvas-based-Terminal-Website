# HTML5 Canvas based Terminal / Command-line Website

This example is created using two simple HTML5 Canvases.

1.  Canvas to emulate Terminal data
2.  Canvas to emulate Cursor Blink

```html
<canvas id="terminalCanvas"></canvas>
<canvas id="cursorCanvas"></canvas>
```

**JS framework**: jQuery

The whole animation works in three parts:
1.  Basic Terminal Setup
2.  Printing "Wake up Neo !!!"
3.  Printing "Dwij Bird"
4.  Printing Menu and enabling the Link Selector for Menu
